# Spectacles (alpha)

Spectacles is open source software for creating active archives of digital
texts. It allows for user-created rich media annotations of those texts, as
well as fuzzy search over both texts and annotations. Additionally it uses
natural language processing techniques to allow users to browse annotations and
texts similar to those they've found relevant to their research needs. These
tools work together to support speculative analysis of the texts in the
archive.

You can view an active archive created with spectacles at our website,
[http://spectacles.pw](http://spectacles.pw).

**Spectacles is currently still under development** and should be considered to
be alpha-version software. Read and run the code at your own risk. Please feel
free to submit issues or contact the authors directly with any questions.
